Here are some materials for some of the courses I have taught at University of
Tampere. Some of this stuff is pretty old already and  my thinking
has certainly changed quite a bit since I collected these materials.


### 2016-2017

- [Russian morphology](/courses/morfologia)


### 2015-2016

- [Russian aspect + motion verbs](/courses/aspekti)
